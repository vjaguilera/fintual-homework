# Fintual Homework
You know, Fintual stuff...

The challenge consist (by them words) of:

__Construct a simple Portfolio class that has a collection of Stocks and a "Profit" method that receives 2 dates and returns the profit of the Portfolio between those dates. Assume each Stock has a "Price" method that receives a date and returns its price.__

**Bonus Track**: make the Profit method return the "annualized return" of the portfolio between the given dates.

So I did this:

TBC

I also added:
- Capabilities to run the project with Docker (if you dont have Python but Docker, which I consider imposible :joy:)
- A pre-commit hook if you want to edit this project :handshake:
- A `setup.cfg` file to declare project configurations
